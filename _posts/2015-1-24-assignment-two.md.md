This assignment will introduce you to OpenStreetMap feature tracing and tagging. You will also learn a little bit about open data formats and the print functionality in Mapbox Studio.

## Tracing Assignments

In the map below you can see State College, Pennsylvania divided into indivual sections by pink polygons. The map also shows the `#buildings` layer from Mapbox Streets, a global vector tile source built and regularly updated with the OpenStreetMap (OSM) database. As of January 24, 2015, many areas of the OSM database in State College could benefit from someone going through and tracing building outlines. We have assigned each section to a specific contributor. Explore the map until you find your section.
