GitHub is a place to collaboratively work on projects. It's a good place for our code to live and it gives us the option to host live web pages. Think of GitHub as essentially similar to something like our course management system ANGEL. Like ANGEL, we can use GitHub to share files and communicate. We bring up GitHub because a lot of people use it: companies like Mapbox are build their work on it, the White House publishes legislation to it, and Google has been known to mine GitHub user data for potential hires.
