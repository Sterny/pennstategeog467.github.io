As an introduction to the world of web maps, we made concept maps of a list of web mapping and campus mapping focused terms. While this list is by no means exhaustive, and it includes some terms with minimal relevance to the modern world of web mapping, it has provided a effective means of starting conversation. Nearly all of these terms were completely new to students. This project spanned two weeks and three class days. Some of the results are below.
